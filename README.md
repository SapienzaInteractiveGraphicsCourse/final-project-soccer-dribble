## Overview

**Soccer Dribble** is a browser-based 3D soccer game built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It puts the player in direct control of a footballer on a fully realized 3D pitch, complete with teammates, AI-controlled opponents, goalkeepers, a referee, and a dynamic match atmosphere. The game was developed as the final project for the Interactive Graphics course at Sapienza University of Rome.

## Features

### 🎮 Gameplay
- **Full 3D third-person controls** with Pointer Lock API for an immersive experience
- **Game modes**: 3v3 match and Training with freekick and penalty
- **Player switching**: cycle through your teammates with `E`
- **Pass & Shoot system**: hold Left Click to charge a pass, Right Click to shoot (with a curved/diagonal trajectory)
- **Defensive Slide Tackle** with `T`
- **Stamina system**: sprint with `Shift`; stamina depletes and regenerates over time

### 🚀 Boost Mechanic
- Hold `Space` to activate a powerful speed burst that pushes the ball forward
- Boost is tracked by a dedicated yellow HUD bar
- Recharge by running over **glowing boost pads** scattered on the pitch

### 💎 Power-Ups & Bonuses
Collect diamond-shaped pickups on the field to load a special shot (active on next Right Click):
| Bonus | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 🔥 **Super Shot** | 2.5× power, straight trajectory with fire trail |
| ⚡ **Electric Shot** | 2.5× power, unpredictable zig-zag trajectory |

> The bonus is lost if you pass the ball or switch players before shooting.

### 🤖 AI Entities
- **Teammates** — follow tactical positions and attack/defend based on possession state
- **Bots (opponents)** — actively chase the ball and attempt to score
- **Goalkeeper** — defends the goal dynamically, tracking the ball and the player
- **Referee** — patrols the pitch during play

### 🌍 Dynamic Environment
- **Day / Night** lighting, with full HDR/EXR skybox loading
- **Weather system**: Clear, Fog, Rain (15 000 particle rain), Snow (3 000 particle snowfall + ground patches)
- **Stadium spotlights** at night, positioned at the four corners of the arena
- Full PBR grass material (color, normal, roughness, AO maps) and a 3D `.glb` stadium model

### 🎬 Replay System
- After each goal, an automatic replay is triggered, playing back the last few seconds
- Skip the replay at any time by pressing `Space`
- Slow-motion effect with dynamic camera zoom during key moments

### 🧍 Player Customization
Before kick-off, you can customize your player:
- **Shirt color** and **skin tone** via color pickers
- **Hair style** (4 different `.glb` hairstyle accessories) and **hair color**
- Live 3D preview with drag-to-rotate and scroll-to-zoom

### 📊 HUD & Radar
- Scoreboard with HOME / AWAY score and match timer
- Stamina bar and Boost bar
- **Mini-radar** showing player position, ball position, and opponents
- Bonus slot indicator (slot-machine roll animation on pickup)
